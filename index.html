				<p>
					Import your LinkedIn™ data export and instantly see the&nbsp;structure of your professional network:
					countries, industries, positions, and connection dates. Get a&nbsp;clear picture that LinkedIn’s
					feed
					never&nbsp;shows.

				<h2><strong>Take control</strong> of your interactions</h2>
				<p>
					LinkedIn™ decides what you see — not you. Mark your key connections as favourites, track private
					messages, and focus on the people that really matter to your goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead of relying on algorithms, choose who to stay in touch with, and never lose track of
					important
					professional relationships again.

			<h2><strong>Clean up</strong> your network</h2>
			<p>
				Over the years, your network grows — sometimes in directions that no longer match your goals.
				Identify inactive or outdated connections and keep your network aligned with your current interests
				and location.

				<h2><strong>Discover</strong> new connections</h2>
				<p>
					Use advanced filters to find people worth connecting with — by country, company, position, or
					activity
					level.
					Save hours of manual browsing and discover active professionals in your target industry or region.
				</p>
				<p>
					You’ll soon be able to view engagement patterns — see who regularly shares ideas and participates in
					discussions,
					so you can connect with people who truly contribute to your professional field.
