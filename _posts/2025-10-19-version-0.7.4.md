There is a new alpha version of the application available: **v0.7.4-alpha**. This release includes several bug fixes and performance improvements based on user feedback. Notable changes in this version are:

- More robust handling of edge cases in data parsing so that fewer errors occur during profile retrieval.
- Existing connections retrieval order has been changed to prioritize most recent contacts first.
- Fixed an issue where some users experienced disconnections due to database limitations on idle sessions.
